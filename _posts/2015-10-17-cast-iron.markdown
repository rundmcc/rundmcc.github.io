The [Brooks County Cast Iron Skillet Festival](http://skilletfest.com/) is one of my favorite races. Itâ€™s always around that time of the year when the weather starts cooling off. Along the course the locals are out of their homes to bang cast iron skillets, like a country cowbell, in support. Most of the course is shaded by old trees hanging over the road.

I placed 10th overall with an official time of 23:05.
