I showed up for the Labor Day, no frills, 5K race. They were asking for donations to the local food bank or Toys for Tots. Ninety five pounds of food was donated to the [Second Harvest of South Georgia](http://feedingsga.org/).

There was a decent turn out, of 87 runners, for a no frills event. I placed 2nd in my age group with a time of 23:20.
