The [Tallahassee Animal Shelter Foundation](http://animalshelterfoundation.org/) held the 14th annual [Tails and Trails]({{ site.url }}/files/2015-tails-and-trails-form.pdf) race on May 2, 2015. This is a race I’ve been wanting to run for a few years. For the first time this year they offered a half marathon distance, and I couldn’t resist. Registration for all distances totaled 1,085 with 981 runners crossing the finish line. At the race a speaker said that for every 5 runners an animal was sponsored. Based on that count 217 animals were sponsored! Also, 25 animals were also adopted this weekend!

My official finish time was [2:06:36](http://www.gulfwinds.org/raceresults/2015/Tails%20and%20Trails%202015.asp#Half).

My Runkeeper map showed a different course then the [course map]({{site.url}}/files/2015-05-02-tails-and-trails-course.pdf).
