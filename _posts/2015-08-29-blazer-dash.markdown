The 10th annual Valdosta State University Blazer Dash 5K had a great turn out. Proceeds from the event support VSU Campus Wellness and student development within Campus Recreation. I placed 11th overall with a time of 24:02. The guy in 10th place was running with his dog. The dog kept stopping to use the bathroom and I would pass him, then he would pass me. We yo-yoed back and forth the entire race, but he eventually finished a little ahead of me.

After the race I looped back and did an extra mile with Bob Moon. We found a t-shirt on the side of the road that someone dropped. When I picked it up, it was covered with ants. Bob said: “Only in south Georgia are ants so mean that they would attack a shirt.”
