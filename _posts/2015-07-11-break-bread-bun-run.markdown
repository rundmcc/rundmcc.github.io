Valdosta’s hardest 5K course. The race is in Old Wood Valley subdivision, the hilliest neighborhood in the Valdosta area. Of course I couldn’t miss this race!

The [Break Bread Bun Run](http://www.breakbreadbunrun.com/) benefits Valdosta’s Break Bread Together program, which provides one meal a day (five days a week) to area senior citizens who are low income, who are home-bound and who, without caregivers, are unable to prepare meals for themselves. The ministry began 40 years ago by a group of devoted women at [First Presbyterian](http://www.firstpresvaldosta.org/Bun-Run.html). To this day, the program is funded entirely by local contributions and special events, like the Break Bread Bun Run.

I took home a unique award for winning second place in my age group. My official time is 25:42.
