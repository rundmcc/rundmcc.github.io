I have ran this race a few times in the past. Usually it’s extremely hot with little shade. Thankfully this year it was foggy with an overcast, which kept the temperature down. Each year Barnes Healthcare Services selects a different local charity to donate the money to. This year they chose the [Boys and Girls Club of Valdosta](http://www.bgcvaldosta.org/). Read more in [The Valdosta Daily Times](http://www.valdostadailytimes.com/sports/barnes-k-gives-back-to-the-local-community/article_5b1ae176-2db4-11e5-8c12-e3558abbd7e5.html) article about the race.

On the last mile I passed a few runners. One guy that I passed can be seen sprinting behind me in the photo below. As I was approaching the finish line he came flying by me, and there was nothing I could do about it. I had no idea he was coming and he was killing it. My official finish time was 24:16. He crossed the finish line less than 4 seconds before me. As soon as we crossed the finish line he hit the bushes and started puking his guts out. I asked him, “was it worth it?” he said “yeah…” and then puked some more.
